## Hacker's Monitor for XFCE<img align="right" src="hkmon.png" />

### Features

* Low resources usage (about 0.26% CPU in a i5-2520M): fully written in C++
* Text mode: only precise data, no rough fancy graphs
* Tiny size with the essential data but...
* ... hugely extended information in the tooltip (see the picture) which still can be on top of every window while you type (of course provided the mouse remains over it)
* Intelligent: speed units change between Kbps and Mbps but are cleverly formatted (e.g. it changes 965 Kbps â†” 1.100 Mbps: you don't need to track the label to perceive the speed direction, while other monitors swap 965 Kbps and 1.1 Mbps)
* The network interface shown in the panel is automatically selected (highest accumulated traffic). If you prefer another one, simply add its name (eth0, ppp0, etc) to the command line. The tooltip shows all the network interfaces with at least one byte transferred, and a mark signaling which one is being reported in the panel.

### Installation

* Download [xfce-hkmon.cpp](xfce-hkmon.cpp) and compile it (you **only** need gcc or clang installed):
```bash
g++ -std=c++0x -O3 -lrt xfce-hkmon.cpp -o xfce-hkmon
```
* Place the executable somewhere (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
* Add a XFCE Generic Monitor Applet (comes with most distros) with these settings: no label, 1 second period, *Bitstream Vera Sans Mono* font (recommended) and the following command:
```
/usr/local/bin/xfce-hkmon NET CPU TEMP IO RAM
```

### Notes

* The tooltip shows a CPU usage resume (all cores) and a brief breakdown by core. The speed summary displayed at the top is weighted by real usage (thus it can run from a few MHz all the way to as many GHz as the number of cores available multiplied by their max clock).
* If a virtual machine is running, *guest* or *guest nice* CPU values will be reported showing its expenditure (on the other hand, if this monitor's computer runs inside a virtual machine, a *steal* value could be reported).
* If a device (network or disk) is moving a single bit of data, the related arrow (triangle) will remain black (the IO or bandwidth value meanwhile may be 0 under too little data transferred).
* Only physical disks with data transferred since boot are reported.
* The temperature shown in the panel area is the highest read among all cores and sockets (if there are several cores or sockets, the tooltip groups them reporting the max/min/avg instead)
* The command line arguments mostly select the tooltip verbosity (RAM will be shown in the panel in place of the temperature when omitted, though). Old XFCE versions may not show the tooltip contents (only the application binary path) if too much data is on it.
* The application writes temporary data in shared memory (SSD friendly) usually in /run/user/\<PID\> to store its previous state (since it is periodically executed). The binary will be cached by Linux, thus there is little performance penalty on this setup. The test machine (Core i5-2520M) was at 0.60% CPU while idle with no monitor, 0.86% CPU with the monitor running and 1.17% CPU with the tooltip open (due to Xorg activity, because the monitor always generates the tooltip, even while hidden).
* Of course, a true XFCE applet would also be nice... hoping that somebody forks this project!
